### Areeb-ul-Haq
I am a student of MCS Enrolled in  in DAA fall 2021 in PAF KIET. I have cleared my B.com from Karachi university and I Like to switch my field from Commerce to Computer Science so I take a decision and took addmission in MCS. Currently I have cleared 14 courses and enrolled for other remaining subjects.

### How we Approach the code:
Firstly we create an array of the given number by applying same number of rows and columnsand then we place a queen in 0,0 and check that the 0,0 value covers how many diagonal in the given number of rows and column and after that we check the remaining diagonal which will not covered and place the queen in it to fill all the diagonal.
